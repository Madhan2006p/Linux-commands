🔥 Awesome — you’re essentially building a **mini-toolkit of Linux utilities**. To do this properly, you need both **a roadmap of increasing difficulty** and **clear system concepts** to cover. Let’s design it step by step 👇

# 🛠️ Roadmap to Re-creating Linux Commands

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Foundation (Basics of File I/O & Directories)

**Goal:** Learn how Linux represents files & directories.
**Commands to re-create:**

1. `echo` → Print text to stdout (`printf`, `write`)
2. `cat` → Read a file and print its contents (`open`, `read`, `write`)
3. `ls` → List directory entries (`opendir`, `readdir`)
4. `pwd` → Print current working directory (`getcwd`)

🔑 **Concepts Learned:**

* File descriptors, system calls
* Buffering & standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr)
* Directory navigation

---

## 📌 Phase 2: File Manipulation

**Goal:** Work with file operations & metadata.
**Commands to re-create:**

1. `cp` → Copy files (`read` + `write` loop)
2. `mv` → Move files (`rename`, or copy + delete)
3. `rm` → Delete files (`unlink`)
4. `touch` → Create empty file / update timestamp (`open` with `O_CREAT`)

🔑 **Concepts Learned:**

* System calls (`open`, `creat`, `unlink`, `rename`)
* File modes & permissions
* Timestamps (`utime`)

---

## 📌 Phase 3: Permissions & Attributes

**Goal:** Explore file metadata, users, groups.
**Commands to re-create:**

1. `chmod` → Change file permissions (`chmod`)
2. `chown` → Change ownership (`chown`)
3. `stat` → Show file metadata (`stat`, `lstat`)

🔑 **Concepts Learned:**

* File permission bits (rwx)
* UID/GID and ownership
* File types (regular, dir, symlink)

---

## 📌 Phase 4: Process & System Commands

**Goal:** Understand how Linux manages processes.
**Commands to re-create:**

1. `ps` → List running processes (parse `/proc/`)
2. `kill` → Send signals (`kill(pid, SIGKILL)`)
3. `sleep` → Pause (`sleep`, `nanosleep`)
4. `whoami` → Get current user (`getuid`, `getpwuid`)

🔑 **Concepts Learned:**

* `/proc` filesystem
* Process IDs & signals
* User identity

---

## 📌 Phase 5: Text Processing Utilities

**Goal:** Work with string parsing & searching.
**Commands to re-create:**

1. `grep` → Search patterns in files (basic regex)
2. `wc` → Count lines, words, characters
3. `head` / `tail` → Show first/last N lines
4. `sort` → Sort lines in a file

🔑 **Concepts Learned:**

* String processing
* Regular expressions
* Memory efficiency with streams

---

## 📌 Phase 6: Advanced Utilities

**Goal:** Combine system concepts into powerful tools.
**Commands to re-create:**

1. `find` → Recursively search files (`nftw`, recursion)
2. `df` → Show disk usage (`statvfs`)
3. `du` → Disk usage per file (`stat`, recursion)
4. `tar` → Archive files (optional, for advanced challenge)

🔑 **Concepts Learned:**

* Recursion in filesystem traversal
* Filesystem statistics
* Compression & archiving concepts

---

## 📌 Phase 7: Shell-like Features (Bonus)

**Goal:** Move towards a *mini-shell environment*.
**Ideas:**

* Build a very basic **shell** (`read`, `fork`, `exec`, `wait`)
* Add support for simple pipelines (`|`)
* Implement background processes (`&`)

---

# 🎯 Final Deliverable

By the end, you’ll have:
✅ A collection of mini Linux utilities (your own “busybox-lite”).
✅ A solid understanding of system calls & Unix internals.
✅ A GitHub repo that shows growth in difficulty (great portfolio project).

⚡ Question for you:
Do you want me to **prioritize the roadmap in order of easiest-to-hardest**, or group it in **real-world categories (like file handling, process control, text utilities)** for your GitHub project layout?
